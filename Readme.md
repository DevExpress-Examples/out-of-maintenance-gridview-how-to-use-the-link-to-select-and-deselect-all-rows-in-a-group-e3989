# GridView - How to use the link to select and deselect all rows in a group


<p>In this sample, two links are used: "Select All" and "Unselect All". When the end-user clicks these links, a custom callback is executed. In the grid's CustomCallback event handler, necessary actions are performed to select / unselect all rows that belong to the group row based on the link that was clicked.</p>
